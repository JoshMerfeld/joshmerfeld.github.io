I teach a class on development here at the KDI School. One of the things
I like to do is introduce students to different empirical measures of
progress we have made in development – especially with respect to
poverty – over the past few decades. During a week on human capital, we
talk about mortality and life expectancy. We have made huge strides
across the globe in reducing child mortality and increasing life
expectancy.

This is easy to see in the data, which I have taken from Our World in
Data (Dattani et al. 2023). The data show that child mortality has
fallen dramatically over the past few decades. The graph below shows the
*percentage* of children who die before reaching their fifth birthday.
Over just forty years, the global child mortality rate has decreased
from 18.44 percent to 6.45 percent. Wonderful progress, indeed!

But while child mortality is relatively straightforward to interpret,
life expectancy is a bit more difficult. I always ask my students what
“life expectancy” means. Most of the time, I get a response along the
lines of “it is how long we expect someone born today to live.” This,
however, is not quite right! Instead, it uses *current* age-specific
mortality rates to calculate the average number of years a person can
expect to live if they were to experience the age-specific mortality
rates of a given period over the course of their life. What?

## Life expectancy with data

Let’s look at some data to put this in context. I have downloaded data
from the UK’s Office of National Statistics, which you can find
[here](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/lifeexpectancies/datasets/mortalityratesqxbysingleyearofage).
Specifically, I have taken the data on male life expectancy in England
and copy-pasted that into a new csv file. Let’s load the data and see
what it shows.

``` r
library(tidyverse)

data <- read_csv("mortalityengland.csv")
data <- data |>
    select(age, mortality=`2021-2023`) 
```

``` r
head(data)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 × 2
    ##     age mortality
    ##   <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1     0  0.00455 
    ## 2     1  0.000244
    ## 3     2  0.000172
    ## 4     3  0.000106
    ## 5     4  0.000084
    ## 6     5  0.000086

Looking at the data, you can see that at age zero, the mortality value
is 0.0045. This means that the probability a child dies before turning
one is 0.0045, or 0.45 percent. Another way to think about this is that
for every 100,000 children, 455 will die before their first birthday,
while 99,545 will *survive*.

Of those survivors, we can continue to age one, where age-specific
mortality is 0.0002. We can do the same calculation, and see that
approximately 99,521 children, out of the original 100,000, will survive
to their second birthday.[1]

Now, you could imagine going through this process with all 100,000
newborns, calculating the probability of surviving or dying at a given
age, using these age-specific mortality rates. We could make sure to
note the age at which a hypothetical person dies, and then using this
age for our 100,000 people, calculate the average age at death. This is
exactly what life expectancy is: it is the average age at death using
*current* age-specific mortality rates.

Let’s do that with the data. First, a small note: the data I downloaded
stops at age 100. We are going to assume anyone still alive at 100 dies
then. This means that our life expectancy calculation will be slightly
low, but it should still give you a good idea of how this works. Let’s
make that change at age 100:

``` r
# assume everyone dies at 100
data$mortality[data$age==100] <- 1
```

Now, we are going to calculate the probability of surviving at *each*
age, for 100,000 different people. We will do this using one of `R`’s
most powerful tools: apply functions. When I first learned `R`, I
avoided these and defaulted to for loops, which is what I was use to.
But the apply functions are much faster and more efficient. We can do
this in one line of code:

``` r
# get 100,000 people, randomly draw values
set.seed(130945)
random_samples <- sapply(data$mortality, function(x) sample(0:1, 100000, prob=c(1-x, x), replace = TRUE))
```

Let me explain these two lines of code. The first line is setting a
seed. This allows us to reproduce a (pseudo) random function in `R`. The
second line usins the `sapply()` function, and we tell it to go through
every single value of `data$mortality`. For each value, we sample
100,000 values from a binomial distribution, where the probability of
success is `1 - data$mortality`. This means that if the mortality rate
is 0.01, the probability of surviving is 0.99. So, for each person, we
get a probability of surviving at each and every age. The new
`random_samples` object will have dimensions of 100,000 x 101, where
each row is a person and each column is an age (from 0 to 100, so 101
values).

Now this doesn’t quite get us to where we want to go. What we are going
to do is find the first time an individual “dies” – that is, the first
time they have a value of 1. We can then use `which()` to find the age
at which they die:

``` r
death_events <- apply(random_samples, 1, function(sample) {
    which(sample == 1)[1]
})
death_events <- death_events - 1
mean(death_events)
```

    ## [1] 78.60119

We are again using one of the apply functions, this time `apply()`. We
are telling `apply()` to go through each *row* of `random_samples` (that
is what the 1 represents; if you wanted to go through columns, you would
use a 2 instead), and for each row, find the first time they have a
value of 1, which in our example represents mortality.[2] Since the
first value is actually age zero, we then subtract one from the result.
Finally, we take the average of all these ages, which gives us the
average age at death.

We can plot this using a histogram, with 101 bins (one for each age):

``` r
ggplot() +
    geom_histogram(aes(x=death_events, y=after_stat(count/sum(count))), bins=101) +
    labs(title="Histogram of mortality", x="Age at death", y="Proportion") +
    theme_bw()
```

There you have it! This shows the distribution of ages at death, using
the age-specific mortality rates for 2021-2023 England. By taking the
mean across all these ages, we get the average age at death, which is
78.6 years. This is a slight underestimate of the official value, which
is most likely due to the fact that we assumed everyone dies at age 100.
Indeed, we can see the increase in mortality at age 100 in the histogram
above; many of them would have lived to be older, but we cut them off at
100 since we didn’t have data beyond that age.

[1] It’s worth noting that mortality rates for children are quite high
just after birth, but then decrease rapidly. This is why the number of
survivors is so high at age one relative to age zero.

[2] `which(sample == 1)` returns the index for ALL values of 1, but we
just want to extract the *first* value, which we do with the `[1]` at
the end.
